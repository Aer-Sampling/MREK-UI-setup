How to select installation folder URL for GitHub?

Use the following format: 

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{your-account-name}/{your-repo-name}/{branch}/Installer/

Note: For some reason, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kcloke/MREK-UI-setup/gh-pages/Installer/ can still be used even though the ownership has been transferred to Aer Sampling (Organization). It should have been https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aer-Sampling/MREK-UI-setup/gh-pages/Installer/ instead. The old link is probably directed to the new link.
