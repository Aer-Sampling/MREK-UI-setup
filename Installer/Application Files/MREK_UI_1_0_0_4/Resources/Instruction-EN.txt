To connect to meter console, click on the settings button at top right of the window.\nHover your mouse over "Connection", then over "COM Port".\nSelect the correct COM port.\nThen, click on "Connect" from the same drop-down menu.
Click on the respective Method name to start.
Measure the dimensions required and fill in the respective boxes. Click "Next" to proceed.
Choose the the total sampling points and the number of porthole(s) that will be used during sampling.\nMark the probe using the lengths listed on the table.\nThe points are to be matched with outside of the porthole for each traverse point.
To measure velocity head and temperature of the flue gas, place the tip of the pitot tube at traverse points starting from Port 1 Point 1 and click "Record".\nProceed to the next point and click "Record" again.\nRepeat until the last traverse point. 
To measure static pressure, follow the procedures in field guide.\nSwitch the disconnection of manometer sides if ΔP reading is negative.\nSelect "Positive" or "Negative" from the drop-down menu according to disconnected manometer connection.\nClick on "Record" button to record the reading.
Click on "Update" button to refresh barometric pressure reading.
Analyze the flue gas sample and fill in the percent concentration of each gases in their respective boxes.
Prepare the sampling train according to procedures in field guide and fill in the boxes at the top section.\nY and ΔH@ value can be obtained from meter console's calibration certificate.
To turn on the heaters, enter the desired temperature for probe or filter and click on "Set" button.\nTo start sampling for Method 4, position the probe at first traverse point and click "Start". 
Move the probe tip to the next traverse point when countdown timer reaches zero. Repeat to the last traverse point.\nSampling will pause automatically before changing port.\nResume sampling after positioning the probe tip at first traverse point of new port.
Sampling paused. Click "Resume" to resume sampling.
Sampling completed. Perform sample recovery and enter the final volume/weight of the impingers in their respective boxes.
Fill in ΔH@ value obtained from meter console's calibration certificate.
Select a nozzle size as close to the calculated ideal nozzle size as you can.\nEnter it's diameter into the "Nozzle diameter chosen" box.
Prepare the sampling train according to procedures in field guide and fill in the boxes at the top section.\nY value can be obtained from meter console's calibration certificate.\nMinimum sampling time per traverse point for USEPA Method 5 is 2 minutes.
To turn on the heaters, enter the desired temperature for probe or filter and click on "Set" button.\nTo start sampling for Method 5, position the probe at first traverse point and click "Start". 
Isokinetic rate for Method 5 sampling runs are shown below. Click "Done" to return to menu.

Error on run 
Please redo.
Preheat the heaters by clicking the "Set" buttons.\nTo start leak check, block the sampling train inlet and click "Start".\nBefore stopping, slowly release the blockage and click "Stop".
To test for leak at positive pitot line, pressurize the line to desired test point and click on "Start" button.\nRepeat for negative line but pull vacuum instead of pressurizing.
Connect the sensor to be calibrated to a reference equipment.\nProvide input until the reference reading reaches desired value.\nRecord the reference reading in its respective box and click on "Calibrate" button.\nTo adjust the sensors, tick the checkbox for the ones you wish to adjust and save.
Click on "Start" button to start calibration process.\nTo add another run, click on "Next Run" and repeat the process.\nClick on "End Test" to proceed to result page.
Calibration results are shown in the table. Click "Done" to return to menu.
Select the feature by clicking on its name.
Click on the name of the data you want to export.\nAssign a file name and click "Save".
Make sure COM port shown matches port for connected console.\nSelect new firmware file and click "Update". 
Fill in details for the project in their respective boxes.

Achieving desired temperature
Vacuum level is high! Unplug the nozzle before stopping! Do you really want to stop the pump?
0.00057 m3/min (0.020 cfm) or 4 percent of the average sampling rate (whichever is less)
Pretest: 381 mm (15 in) Hg\nPost-test: vacuum equal to or greater than the maximum value reached during the sampling run
Click on refresh button on the left to update barometer value.
(not used) Use 'STACK' thermocouple socket for adjustment. 'STACK', 'PROBE' and 'OVEN' share the same adjustment.
(not used) Use 'FILTER' thermocouple socket for adjustment. 'FILTER' and 'EXIT' share the same adjustment.
